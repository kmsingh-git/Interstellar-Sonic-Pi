# Interstellar-Sonic-Pi
Create Interstellar theme music with Ruby (using Sonic Pi)

To Do:

Phase 1: Play it as close to the original as possible
- Create the piano layer, that will be the backbone of the piece
  - Should use the grand piano synth or package in Sonic Pi for this
- Violins?
- Church organs?

Phase 2: Introduce variations, maybe rock, maybe house, (hip-hop?)
